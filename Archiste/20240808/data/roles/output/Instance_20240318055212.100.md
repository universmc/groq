It seems like you have provided a list of phases for a project, but you have not asked a specific question. I will assume that you would like to know more about each phase. Here is a brief explanation of each phase:

1. Initialisation of the instance: This is the first phase of the project, where the instance or project is set up. This may include setting up the development environment, creating the project directory, and defining the project scope.
2. Conceptualisation: In this phase, the project team will work on defining the project's goals and objectives. They will also identify the target audience, conduct market research, and create a project plan.
3. Configuration: In this phase, the project team will configure the project's infrastructure. This may include setting up databases, servers, and other technical requirements.
4. Training model IA: This phase involves training the artificial intelligence model. The project team will feed the model data and adjust its parameters to improve its accuracy.
5. Iteration & Des scripts Frontend: In this phase, the project team will work on the frontend development of the project. They will create the user interface and ensure that it is functional and user-friendly.
6. Test & Debugging: This phase involves testing the project to identify any bugs or issues. The project team will then work on fixing these issues to ensure that the project is functioning correctly.
7. Validation & Documentation: In this phase, the project team will validate the project to ensure that it meets the project's objectives. They will also document the project's development process, including any issues encountered and how they were resolved.
8. Deployment system Version: This phase involves deploying the project. The project team will ensure that the project is properly configured and tested before it is launched.
9. Announce affiliation contribution: In the final phase, the project team will announce the project's launch and any affiliations or contributions made by external parties.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
