### Phase 3: Configuration

Estimated Duration: 3 days

1. Configure the database and data storage
2. Set up monitoring and logging
3. Implement security measures
4. Configure backups and disaster recovery

<a name="phase-4"></a>

### Phase 4: Training Model IA

Estimated Duration: 5 days

1. Prepare and clean the data
2. Select and preprocess features
3. Choose and train a machine learning model
4. Evaluate the model and fine-tune
