Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand better the concept of matrix vector embedding, specifically in the context of René Descartes's book "Meditation & Metaphysique" and metadata modeling.

In natural language processing and machine learning, word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. They are a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging natural language processing problems.

One popular technique for creating word embeddings is Word2Vec, which was developed by a team at Google and is based on the distributional hypothesis that "words that occur in the same context share some commonality." Word2Vec uses two model architectures to generate word embeddings: Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Continuous Skip-Gram.

Now, regarding the metadata modeling in a prompt model for citation, you can use the JSON format to define a citation's metadata, including the book title, author, and other relevant information. Here's an example:
```json
{
  "citation": {
    "book_title": "Meditation & Metaphysique",
    "author": "René Descartes",
    "publisher": "The name of the publisher",
    "year": "The year of publication"
  }
}
```
Regarding asynchronous JavaScript (async/await) and JSON, you can use async/await to fetch metadata from a JSON file. Here's an example:
```javascript
async function fetchMetadata() {
  const response = await fetch('metadata.json');
  const metadata = await response.json();
  console.log(metadata);
}

fetchMetadata();
```
In this example, the `fetchMetadata` function fetches the `metadata.json` file asynchronously and logs the metadata to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
