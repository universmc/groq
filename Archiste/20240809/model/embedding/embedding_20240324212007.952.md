Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand more about matrix vector embeddings, specifically in the context of the work "Méditation et Métaphysique" by René Decarte.

In natural language processing (NLP), an embedding is a way to represent words or phrases as vectors in a high-dimensional space, such that the distance and direction between vectors correspond to their semantic relationships. This is useful for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

One popular technique for creating embeddings is word2vec, which uses a neural network to learn the relationships between words in a large corpus of text. The output of word2vec is a set of word vectors, where each word is represented as a dense vector in a high-dimensional space. These vectors can then be used as input to other NLP models.

In the context of your question, matrix vector embeddings can be used to represent relationships between entities in a knowledge graph, such as the relationship between an author and a work. This can be useful for tasks like recommendation systems or information retrieval.

As for your question about metadata in a prompt model for citations, one way to approach this is to include metadata fields like author, title, and publication date in the prompt, and then use an embedding to represent these fields as vectors. For example, you might represent the author's name as a vector using word2vec, or you might use a separate embedding space for each metadata field.

In terms of implementing this in asynchronous JavaScript/JSON, you could use a library like TensorFlow.js to load and manipulate the embeddings. You might also use a JSON schema to define the structure of the metadata fields in the prompt, and use a JSON parser to convert the input prompts into a format that can be processed by your model.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
