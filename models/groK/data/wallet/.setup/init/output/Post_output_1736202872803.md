That's a good start! It looks like you're setting up a template for describing AI tasks and their outcomes.  

To make it more useful, let's flesh it out with some examples.  Here's how you could complete the template:

**Example 1: Text Summarization**

```json
{
  "context": "A long news article about the latest scientific discovery.",
  "role": "assistant",
  "tasks": ["Summarization", "Information Extraction"],
  "expectedOutcome": "A concise and accurate summary of the key findings and implications of the article."
}
```

**Example 2: Image Captioning**

```json
{
  "context": "A photograph of a bustling street scene.",
  "role": "generator",
  "tasks": ["Image Description", "Natural Language Generation"],
  "expectedOutcome": "A descriptive and engaging caption that accurately captures the essence of the image."
}
```

**Key Points to Remember:**

* **Context:**  Provide a brief description of the input data the AI will be working with.
* **Role:** Define the AI's function in this scenario (e.g., assistant, generator, evaluator).
* **Tasks:** List the specific actions the AI is expected to perform.
* **expectedOutcome:** Clearly state the desired result of the AI's processing.
