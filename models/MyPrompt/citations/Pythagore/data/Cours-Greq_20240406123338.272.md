The subject (subject) is the atomic form or thing that performs the active representation of the verb, expressed by the verb.
The verb (verb) is the active representation performed by the subject and has similarity with the subject in genus, number, and person.
The adjective (complement) is the added word for the complete presentation of the phrase, such as the specified one, what or how or where or when the verb is.
The syntax (context) is the logical and cultural world by which words or statements are used, and differs proportionally over time and place where they are used.

In the context of the Pythagorean quote "Πάντα ἀριθμός ἐστιν" (Toute chose est nombre), it is important to understand the role of numbers and mathematics in the philosophical and metaphysical beliefs of the Pythagoreans.

The Pythagoreans believed that numbers and mathematics were the fundamental elements of the universe, and that all things could be explained and understood through mathematical principles. They believed that numbers had inherent qualities and meanings, and that the universe was built upon a foundation of mathematical relationships and patterns.

For example, the Pythagoreans believed that the number 1 represented unity and the starting point for all things, while the number 2 represented duality and the concept of opposites. The number 3 was considered the first odd number and represented the concept of harmony and balance, while the number 4 represented stability and the four elements of the universe (earth, air, fire, and water).

The Pythagoreans applied these mathematical principles to all aspects of their lives, including music, art, and architecture. They believed that the beauty and harmony found in these areas could be explained through mathematical relationships and proportions.

In conclusion, the Pythagorean quote "Πάντα ἀριθμός ἐστιν" reflects the deep and fundamental belief in the importance of numbers and mathematics in the metaphysical and philosophical beliefs of the Pythagoreans. They believed that all things could be understood and explained through mathematical principles and relationships, and that numbers had inherent qualities and meanings that were reflected in all aspects of the universe.

It is important to note that the Pythagorean understanding of the relationship between numbers and the universe was not a scientific or mathematical one, but rather a philosophical and metaphysical one. The Pythagoreans were not concerned with the precise mathematical calculations and measurements that are used in modern science and mathematics, but rather with the underlying principles and relationships that govern the universe.

In this way, the Pythagorean understanding of the relationship between numbers and the universe can be seen as a form of metaphysical mathematics, in which the underlying principles and relationships of the universe are expressed through mathematical concepts and relationships. This approach to understanding the universe has had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy and science, and continues to influence our understanding of the world today.
