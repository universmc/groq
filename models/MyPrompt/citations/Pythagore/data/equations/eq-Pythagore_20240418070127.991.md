Sure, here is a metaphysical demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem `a² + b² = c²` represented geometrically using ASCII characters:
```lua
       /\
      /  \
     /    \
    /      \
a /________\ b
   \______/
      |
      |
      c
```
In this representation, the two shorter sides of the right triangle (a and b) are represented by the two legs of the triangle, and the longest side (c) is represented by the hypotenuse. The equation `a² + b² = c²` shows the relationship between the lengths of the three sides.

This geometric representation of the Pythagorean theorem can help us better understand the relationship between the sides of a right triangle and the significance of the theorem in geometry and mathematics.

By using ASCII characters to create a visual representation of the theorem, we are able to see the theorem in a new way and gain a deeper understanding of its meaning and implications. This demonstrates the power of geometry and mathematics to help us understand the world around us and make sense of complex concepts.
