Sure, here's a metaphysical demonstration of Pythagore's theorem in the form of an ASCII-art triangle. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:

a² + b² = c²

Here's a metaphysical interpretation of this equation, represented as an ASCII-art triangle:

---------------------
a                   b
                   
                    c
```
In this representation, `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two shorter sides of the triangle, and `c` is the length of the hypotenuse. The triangle is depicted as a series of lines, with the length of each line representing the corresponding side length.

This ASCII-art triangle illustrates the metaphysical concept of the theorem, where the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (represented by the total length of the lines on the left and right of the triangle) is equal to the square of the hypotenuse (represented by the length of the central line).

By using ASCII art to represent the Pythagorean theorem, we can gain a deeper understanding of the theorem and its metaphysical implications. The use of lines and spaces to represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle allows us to visualize the theorem in a new and unique way, and to explore its deeper meanings and interpretations.

So, in a nutshell, the Pythagorean theorem is not just a mathematical formula, but a metaphysical concept that can be represented and visualized in many different ways. By using ASCII art to represent the theorem, we can gain a deeper understanding of its meaning and implications, and explore its connections to the world around us.
