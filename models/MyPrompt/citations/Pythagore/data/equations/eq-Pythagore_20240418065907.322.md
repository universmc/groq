Sure! Here is a metaphysical demonstration of Pythagoras' theorem, represented as an ASCII art triangle:

```
         _
___,--' `--'--'-.
\      /_  /_  '_`'.
 `._,'`--'  --'  ,'
   `._      _,--'
     `-----'
```

This triangle represents the famous Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be represented by the equation:

${a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$

Where $c$ represents the length of the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the other two sides.

This theorem has many applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering and is a fundamental concept in the field of geometry. It is a reminder of the power and beauty of mathematics, and the ways in which simple ideas can have far-reaching implications.

I hope this ASCII art representation helps to illustrate the beauty and elegance of Pythagoras' theorem. Let me know if you have any other questions about this topic or if there is anything else I can help with!
